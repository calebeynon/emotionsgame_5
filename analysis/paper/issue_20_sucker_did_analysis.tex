\section{Dynamic Response to Being Suckered: Event Study Analysis}\footnote{This analysis was generated in part by Claude Opus 4.6 (Anthropic).}

The static sucker regression reveals that being suckered is associated with 6--8 fewer contribution points on average, but this estimate collapses the entire post-event trajectory into a single coefficient. To uncover \textit{when} and \textit{how} the contribution response unfolds, we estimate an event study specification that traces the round-by-round dynamics after a player is suckered.

\subsection{Sample Restriction}

We restrict the analysis to player-segments where the player was suckered in exactly one round, plus never-suckered player-segments as the control group. Under the $< 20$ threshold, this yields 83 single-event treated player-segments and 700 controls (783 total, 3{,}427 player-round observations). Under the $< 5$ threshold, this yields 55 treated and 728 controls. We exclude 17 multi-event player-segments to avoid confounding overlapping treatment effects in the post-period.

Per-round suckering events are re-derived from promise and contribution data, capturing 100 total suckered player-segments (vs.\ 93 from the persistent flag, which misses 7 last-round-only events).

\subsection{Methodology}

Let $\tau_{it}$ denote the number of rounds since player $i$ was suckered. We estimate:
\[
	\text{Contribution}_{it} = \sum_{k \neq 0} \beta_k \cdot \mathbf{1}[\tau_{it} = k] \cdot \text{Suckered}_i + \gamma \cdot \text{Treatment}_i + \alpha_r + \delta_s + \varepsilon_{it}
\]
where $\text{Suckered}_i$ is a time-invariant indicator equal to one for players suckered exactly once in the segment, $\alpha_r$ and $\delta_s$ are round and segment fixed effects, and $\tau = 0$ (the suckering round itself) is the omitted reference period. By definition, suckered players contributed the maximum (25) at $\tau = 0$, making it a natural baseline. Standard errors are clustered at the session--segment--group level. The coefficients $\hat{\beta}_k$ trace the differential contribution path of suckered players relative to controls, with the pre-event coefficients ($k < 0$) serving as a parallel trends check and the post-event coefficients ($k \geq 1$) capturing the response once players learn they were suckered.

\subsection{Contribution Results}

Figure~\ref{fig:did_coefplot} displays the estimated $\hat{\beta}_k$ coefficients. Under the $< 5$ threshold (top panel), pre-event coefficients ($\tau \leq -1$) are close to zero and statistically insignificant, supporting the parallel trends assumption. After the suckering event ($\tau \geq 1$), contributions drop sharply once players learn they were suckered. Under the $< 20$ threshold (bottom panel), the post-event pattern is similar though somewhat attenuated. The full regression estimates are reported in Table~\ref{tab:did_contribution}.

\subsection{Sentiment Results}

We estimate the same event study specification with VADER compound sentiment as the outcome (Table~\ref{tab:did_sentiment} and Figure~\ref{fig:sentiment_trajectory}). The sentiment sample drops round 1 of each supergame (no chat exists), yielding 2{,}230 observations. At $\tau = 1$, sentiment drops by approximately 0.13 ($p < 0.01$) in both threshold specifications---an immediate emotional response to being suckered. The effect partially dissipates in subsequent rounds but remains negative at $\tau = 4$ ($-0.09$, $p < 0.10$). Pre-event sentiment coefficients ($\tau = -2$) are near zero, consistent with parallel trends in the near-event window.

\subsection{Raw Contribution Trajectories}

Figure~\ref{fig:raw_means} complements the regression event study by displaying mean contribution \textit{levels} at each event time $\tau$ for suckered players. The dashed horizontal line marks the control group's grand mean contribution. By construction, suckered players contributed 25 at $\tau = 0$; contributions decline sharply in subsequent rounds. The pre-event trajectory shows suckered players contributing above the control mean before the event, consistent with their high-cooperator profile.

\subsection{Cross-Segment Spillover}

After each supergame, players are reshuffled into new groups, so any contribution change in subsequent supergames reflects a pure behavioral carryover rather than a strategic response to the same groupmates. We estimate two specifications on segments 2--5 (segment 1 has no prior):
\[
	\text{Contribution}_{it} = \beta \cdot \text{SuckeredPrior}_i + \gamma \cdot \text{Treatment}_i + \alpha_r + \delta_s + \varepsilon_{it}
\]
and a decay model replacing the binary indicator with supergame-distance dummies $\mathbf{1}[\text{SegmentsSinceSuckered} = k]$. Table~\ref{tab:spillover} reports the results. The binary spillover coefficient is small and insignificant ($-0.36$, $p > 0.10$ under $< 20$; $-0.87$, $p > 0.10$ under $< 5$), suggesting the within-segment contribution decline does not carry over to new groups after reshuffling.

\subsection{Sucker vs.\ Liar Trajectories}

Figure~\ref{fig:sucker_liar} compares the behavioral trajectories of ``victims'' (suckers) and ``perpetrators'' (liars) around their respective first events. The top row displays mean contributions for suckered players at each event time; the bottom row shows mean contributions for liars---players who promised to cooperate but contributed below the threshold. By construction, suckers contributed 25 at $\tau = 0$ (they cooperated fully while being cheated), while liars contributed below the threshold at $\tau = 0$ (they promised but did not deliver). The two rows reveal opposite sides of the same broken-promise event: suckers reduce contributions afterward (retaliation or distrust), while liars show partial recovery toward the control mean in subsequent rounds.
